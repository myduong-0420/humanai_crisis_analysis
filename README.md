# AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis for Suicide Prevention, Substance Use, and Mental Health Crisis Detection with Longitudinal Geospatial Crisis Trend

### Task 1. Social Media Data Extraction & Preprocessing (API Handling & Text Cleaning)
ðŸ“ŒÂ **Deliverable:**
- AÂ **Python script**Â that retrieves and storesÂ **filtered social media posts**.
- AÂ **cleaned dataset**Â ready for NLP analysis.
The cleaned dataset with tokenized text has the name `reddit_posts_cleaned.csv`, but additional datasets were curated to work with task 2 and task 3 more conveniently. `reddit_data_with_sa.csv` contains sentiment scores generated by VADER and Textblob, `sample_test_with_risk_words.csv` contains risk words and severity of the content, and `reddit_posts_geotags.csv` contains ngrams isolated for geotagging, and geographical cues.

I choose to focus on Reddit data, since I want to try tackling insufficient geotagging with NLP methods. Besides, in sensitive areas like mental health and drug use, it's understandable that original posters (OPs) often choose not to disclose their locations, so geotagging will only work when OPs willingly share about their whereabouts in the posts. While the lack of geographical information feature presents a big challenge about data representation, it is also an ethical standard that I want to uphold. One area that I would like to explore further is to visit regional subreddits (E.g, r/tampa) and make queries with selected keywords, but due to time and compute constraint (explained in the next task), I was not able to do this.


### Task 2. Sentiment & Crisis Risk Classification (NLP & Text Processing)
ðŸ“ŒÂ **Deliverable:**
- AÂ **script**Â that classifies posts based onÂ **sentiment and risk level**.
- AÂ **table or plot**Â showing theÂ **distribution of posts by sentiment and risk category**.



### Task 3. Crisis Geolocation & Mapping (Basic Geospatial Analysis & Visualization)
ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:**
- AÂ **Python script**Â that geocodes posts and generates aÂ **heatmap**Â of crisis discussions.
- AÂ **visualization of regional distress patterns**Â in the dataset.
